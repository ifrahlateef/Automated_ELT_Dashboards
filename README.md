# Business Intelligence: Enterprise Readiness & Strategic OKR Framework

##  Executive Summary & Strategic Impact
I **orchestrated** the digital transformation of the Business Readiness reporting cycle, migrating the organization from a manual, fragmented outreach process to a **fully autonomous strategic command center**. 

By **partnering with Heads of Departments (HODs)** across the Sky Estate, I synthesized cross-functional KPIs into a unified framework. This project removed the "reporting lag" that previously hindered executive agility, providing the leadership team with **real-time visibility** into the health of the estate.

### Achievements:
* **Architected** a multi-modal data ingestion engine (API, SQL, Cloud) to eliminate organizational data silos.
* **Operationalized** the corporate OKR framework by mapping live performance telemetry to strategic business objectives.
* **Engineered** a resilient semantic layer that converted raw, unstructured service data into "Executive-Ready" insights.

##  Technical Architecture & Advanced ETL
Rather than a standard dashboard build, I developed a sophisticated data pipeline designed for scale and accuracy across the Sky Estate.



### 1. Hybrid Ingestion & API Orchestration
Recognizing that enterprise data resides in diverse environments, I **developed a custom middleware solution** to ensure data fluidity:
* **Python-Driven Extraction:** Authored scripts to interface with third-party service APIs, capturing real-time telemetry from the "Cyber" and "Tools" pillars.
* **Direct Query Optimisation:** Configured high-performance SQL connections to maintain a live link to the estate database, ensuring zero-latency reporting.
* **Cloud Ingest:** Built automated extraction pipelines to monitor "Collaboration" metrics within cloud-native environments.

### 2. Stakeholder Management & Metric Discovery
A core responsibility was the **alignment of departmental goals**. I led the "Data Discovery" phase by:
* Collaborating with HODs to identify and define high-impact KPI metrics.
* Translating abstract business needs into measurable data points across **Cyber, Culture, Office Space, and Support**.

##  Analytical Transformation & Visualization
I utilised advanced Business Intelligence techniques to transform raw data into a strategic narrative that facilitates data-driven decision-making.

### Data Modeling & DAX Engineering
* **Data Hygiene & Integrity:** Implemented robust cleaning logic to handle NULL values and discrepancies, ensuring the dashboard remains a "Single Source of Truth."
* **Advanced Semantic Layer:** Engineered complex **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create ready-to-use metrics and time-intelligence calculations.
* **Trend Analysis:** Developed **Historic Trend Lines** to allow leadership to distinguish between one-time anomalies and systemic performance patterns.

##  Business Value & Decision Support
The framework directly empowers the Leadership Team to move from a reactive to a **proactive posture**:
* **Real-Time Insights:** Immediate visibility into which services require urgent intervention or resource reallocation.
* **OKR Alignment:** Every metric is tied to an **Objective and Key Result**, ensuring technical performance is always viewed through the lens of business success.
* **Strategic Foresight:** Historic monitoring allowed for predictive resource planning for the Sky Estate.
